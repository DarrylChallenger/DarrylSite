CHESS IS MATHEMATICS
because of calculation, logical sequencing and abstracting reasoning.
CHESS IS SCIENCE
because games are experiments in which we learn. Because each body is trying to upset the homeostasis of the other body
CHESS IS GEOGRAPHY
because a chessboard has an equator which is called the frontier line, on the 64 squares there are ranks or the lines of latitude, and files are the lines of longitude
CHESS IS SOCIAL AND POLITICAL
because rooks are the banks, the bishops the religious class, the knights the military, the pawns are the everyday people, the king and queen the ruling class.
CHESS IS A STORY
because there is a protagonist and an antagonist. There is a crisis and a climax to most strategic battles. And because each one is a king/hero on their own board
AND
Chess changes three perceptions, how I see myself, how I see the world, and how the world sees me
